# Modpanel Documentation

Modpanel was designed with three goals in mind:

* Mobile access - While Modpanel is less featured on mobile, lacking the left 
hand sidebar, it was built with the goal of being able to moderate your 
community using toolbox reasons and notes from a mobile phone.
* Speed and Accuracy - With posts being removed, notes being left, and bans 
being issued in one fell swoop, it's harder to accidentally remove a post by 
mistake since you can back out of removal reasons, and it's impossible to 
forget a step.
* Collaboration - Modpanel has multiple mechanisms to show you who else is 
around and what they've actioned; helping to prevent double-actioning when 
multiple folks are moderating at once.
